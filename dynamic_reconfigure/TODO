GUI
- Allow a GUI to be made from a list of parameters that are not necessarily all with the same node
- Add support for GUI hints
  - Advanced parameters
  - Enum for integers

Dynparam
- Support enums

General
- Add support for lists of primitive types
- Add support for yaml parameters
- Add test server/client for Python (and client for C++)

C++ Server
- The current error message when an unexpected parameter is found is
  useless. It should just say which parameter is bad and why (unknown/bad
  type)

C++ client
- Make it exist

Generator
- Generate documentation in wiki format (let's wait for the format to stabilize)
- Check that enums don't contain the same value twice.
